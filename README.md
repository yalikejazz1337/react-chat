# React chat application made with Firebase
This is a chat application I made with react.js for the front end, and Firebase as the backend. This is my first real time application that I've built, and it taught me how to use firebase for databse implementation and authentication. I followed a tutorial from freecodecamp for the base, and then used the knowledge I gained from that tutorial, to add my own extensions. I changed the UI a bit and implemented a feature to DM other users.
